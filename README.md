Objective
===

Make a responsive app, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. Follow the Webpack component and router architecture with vanilla JS. Choose appropriate UI and navigational patterns based on your app's functionality and goals.
The app should create, update, and remove image data using Firebase. Cloudinary should be used to serve appropriate responsive images. Sketches of responsive layout and app component structure before developing.

Steps Taken
===

Set up the component architecture with html and vanilla JS. Set up firebase and cloudinary accounts. Create splash entry page, hikes list, hike detail, add hike pages. Set an event listener on the splash page that will redirect user to hikes list and show the header and footer. Use a mixture of flexbox and grid to create resposive, scannable layouts. Create multiple (8!) images of the splash page image for different screen sizes and resolutions. Use media queries to apply these responsive changes. Alter the hike list page to display add a hike in larger screens.

Reflection / Changes
===

This was a large project to create. This was my first time working with cloudinary and firebase. I enjoy the instantaneous feedback a user gets when adding or removing an image. I regret creating a single CSS folder to hold all my CSS. I now see that with a larger app like this with multiple pages / components it is important to keep CSS organized with the components. It was lazy of me to place all of it in one place (app.css), and became more difficult for me to find prior CSS I had applied to elements.
